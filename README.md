# Notes

This is my attempt to create a recipe chatbot using Sveltekit and wit.ai.  The first thing to do is create the interface.  I'm using [this snippet](https://svelte.dev/repl/ce61cb87ea604812a1d1639de66f7a5d?version=3.46.3) as starting point.

* **Step One**
  * Bouncing Dots.  There's a lot for me to unpack in the CSS here.  I'm unfamiliar with `flex` layouts, so I'm studying [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) page.
  * The animation portion seems relatively straight forward, but I looked up
  * some of parameters on the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) site above.
* **Step Two**
  * Though this is for jQuery, I like the composition of [this chatbot interface](https://codepen.io/TVBZ/pen/WmPPyR) a bit more, so we'll use it in conjunction with the svelte example.
  * I've learned a lot about CSS for instance the `fr` [unit](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-fr-unit) and the `vh` [unit](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.php).
  * [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/css-flexbox) helped me create a better CSS `flexbox`.
